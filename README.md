# stepDownConverter
In this project I have designed a DC-DC converter that steps down 48V to 28V, 12V and 5V. The pcb designed is used to distribute the input voltage to a camera, gimbal, flight controller and a radio. This pcb is a part of a high altitude surveillance drone with an endurance of 5hrs.
The pcb uses LM2596 IC and XL4015 IC to step down the voltages. Most of the components used are SMD.
